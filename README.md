**Reconstruction of watertight meshes, annotated volumes and center line skeletons of neuroscience spatial structures from non-watertight inputs, segmented masks, skeletons of NGV morphologies and volumes.**

Ultraliser is an unconditionally robust and high-performance framework dedicated primarily to in silico neuroscience research. Ultraliser is capable of generating high fidelity and multiscale 3D models (surface meshes and annotated volumes) of neuroscientific data, such as nuclei, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, neuronal branches with dendritic spines, minicolumns with thousands of neurons and large networks of cerebral vasculature - with realistic geometries.

**The Blue Brain BioExplorer is a tool for scientists to extract and analyze scientific data for visualization and interactive exploration**

Exploration relies on building software that combines data integration, analysis and interactive visualization to build, modify and navigate through large scientific datasets. For this, Blue Brain built and open-sourced the Blue Brain BioExplorer. It was originally developed to answer key scientific questions related to the Coronavirus as a use case and to deliver a visualization tool. Today, the BioExplorer allows to reconstruct, visualize, explore and describe in detail the structure and function of highly-detailed biological structures such as molecular systems, neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels, and more. You can see the first application of the BioExplorer in [A Machine-Generated View of the Role of Blood Glucose Levels in the Severity of COVID-19](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.695139/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE) study.
